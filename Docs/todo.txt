Play - will make moves that leave K in check
I.e. some moves are illegal but they are not detected as such when gnerated in
 the search.

Find check mates in tree, assign score based on depth so we go for the earliest 
Hmm, should be relatively easy to find check. Then do more costly mate test..?


Castling, e.p.

Pawn promotion

Sort moves to optimise alpha-beta

Iterative deepening

Better evaluation


Move sorting:
 - For check/mate testing, having king-capturing moves at the front is great.
 - For searching too.
 - So when we generate moves, evaluate them and sort..? Then don't evaluate again, just look up the score in the move object.
